# MyReactKit
A Kit to kick start your React Project with Webpack

This is like a Boilerplate designed by me to start any React project. it inludes the following features:
1. Hot reloading
2. Babel to transpile your JSX and Es6 Codes should you choose to use them.
3. Good project structure. in case, you choose to integrate a backend code, just include a directory named 'server' and everything is cool.
4. A readable and customizable webpack.config.js and .babelrc files .
